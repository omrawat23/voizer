Issue Overview
1. List Agents API

    Endpoint: GET /list-agents

    Observation:
    The API returned an empty array ([]) when attempting to fetch the list of agents.
    Screenshot of the response:
   

    Workaround:
    To proceed, I used dummy data for agents during testing and development.

3. Create Agent API

    Endpoint: POST /create-agent

    Observation:
    The API returned a 400 Bad Request with the error message:

    {
      "status": "error",
      "message": "Invalid retell llm id."
    }

    Screenshot of the error:

    Workaround:
    Since the Create Agent API was not functional, I created an agent manually using the dummy data for further testing.

Notes

    Dummy data allowed testing of other features that depend on agents being available.
    Further investigation is required to resolve the Invalid retell llm id error for the Create Agent API.
